# Password Generator Project

Greetings, in the world of faulty cyber security and user information leaks passwords are our only sentinel against dubious hackers. As such, generating a strong password is a necessity in this day and age and it is for this reason I have created a tool to protect our google searches from nefarious fiends. No one is gonna know what amazon purchases we make on our watch. 

## Custom Password 

Most passwords are required to be within a certain character limit as well as be made from various character types which vary far and wide across websites. If the user wishes to create a create a customized password based on the specifications on their website just clicks on the "Custom Password" button and is then presented with a series of prompts asking the user: how long they want their password to be and if they wish to include upper or lower case letters, numbers, or special symbols. The button then combines all of these characters and shuffles them into a password that is set to the user's specified length. The character length is set to be between 8 to 128 characters to accomodate whatever length they may require. As such, if the user chooses a character length that goes outside of the bounds of this range they are prompted with an alert that asks them to refresh the page and start over.

## Default Password

In the event the user does not wish to create a customized password they may generate a default password by clicking the "Default Password" button. The button essentialy works the same as the "Custom Password" button but includes all password options and sets the character length to 16. This button is to facilitate users who need a password quick and do not wish to go through the "Custom Button" password prompts.

## Possible improvements

As I continue to develop this project i'd like to add the following two features

- Button which can hide the password after it's generated
- Button which allows the user to copy the password after it's been generated

New features to come as inspiration strikes!
